# Java Android Quiz App

* A quiz app written in Java that allows you to choose 3 quiz categories
* After selecting a category, 5 questions will be asked for this category - each with 4 options
* A results page shows a summary of your correct answers

* To complete this app I used similar styling to the "To List" project from the "The complete Java Android App development Bootcamp" Udemy course

## Running the app

* Create an android studio project - I used Android studio Jellyfish for my project
* Create a "Empty views activity"
* Copy the contents from "app/src" from Github to "app/src" of your android studio project
* I recommend then using a "Pixel 4 API 28" Emulator
* Then run the project on the phone emulator and it should work
